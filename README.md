This project was an exploration of classification techniques used to classify images from TinyImageNet100, which can found here:
https://datasets.activeloop.ai/docs/ml/datasets/tiny-imagenet-dataset/

There were several parts to this project:
  1. Preparation of data, i.e. randomly choosing classes of images
  2. Image classification using hand-crafted features including SIFT and ORB
  3. Image classification using feed-foward neural network
  4. Image classification using convolutional neural network
